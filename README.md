# Script for Parsing SymGiza output

## Tutorial on testing in python, links to the section on test runners
https://realpython.com/python-testing/#choosing-a-test-runner

## Instructions
from the symgiza_parser or root directory where you can see the test and src folders, run the following:

```
python2.7 test/test_sum_unittest.py
```

You may need to adjust python2.7 to python2 or just python.
Running `python -V` should spit out the version of python you are running.
